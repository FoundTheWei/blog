Everything in our world can be translated into words or numbers. This simple realization is the key to building a knowledge system that AI can traverse as naturally as you navigate your own memories.

## The Setup: Obsidian + Claude Code

I'm running 210+ documents through an Obsidian vault, but here's what makes it work:

### CLAUDE documents in every folder.
These files tell AI:
- Where to find specific information
- Current file structure
- Folder-specific instructions

Think of them as navigation beacons for your AI assistant.

### Sub-agents that process everything.
Using Claude Code, I created agents that:
- Review and chunk transcripts into logical pieces
- Maintain interconnected file structures
- Update documentation as the system evolves

## The Four Principles That Actually Matter

### 1. Dense interconnection beats perfect organization
Link everything. The more pathways between documents, the faster AI finds what it needs.

### 2. Context is multi-dimensional
Words are just the start. Capture:

- Who was involved
- When it happened
- Why it matters
- What situation prompted it

Different documents extract different contexts. Use that.

### 3. Version control isn't optional
Git everything. Your knowledge evolves—track that evolution.

### 4. Embrace messy evolution
Your structure will break. Projects will demand different setups. That's fine. Have your agent periodically review and update the navigation docs.

## Real-World Results (and Problems)

**What's working:**

- AI gives responses that feel like they're from someone who knows my entire history
- Complex project context stays intact across conversations
- Cross-pollination of ideas happens naturally

**Current challenges:**

- Can't pinpoint where AI pulls specific facts from
- Unknown if this scales beyond 1,000 documents
- Local models can't handle the context length (yet)

## The Bigger Picture

Yesterday's impossible is today's normal. Since ChatGPT 3.5, keeping up isn't optional anymore.

> The goal isn't perfect capture—it's maximum navigability.

But here's what most miss: yes, there's data loss when translating reality into words and numbers. That's fine. An interconnected database is still the closest thing we have to a digital brain that AI can actually use.

## Start Here

1. Pick your tool (I use Obsidian)
2. Create navigation documents for AI
3. Build sub-agents for processing
4. Link aggressively
5. Accept imperfection

Because in this new dawn of AI, your knowledge is only as powerful as your AI's ability to traverse it.
